The specific target for this software is scheduling.
But the library's generality should make it useful for other purposes.

Representation notes:

Target estimates:
	<256 classes
	<512 students
	<128 teachers
	~7 blocks
	~2 semesters

Two aspects of the problem:
	When(block/semester) are the classes(where)
	Who(students/teachers) is where when

Approach one:
	b*s*c bytes per person
		where b is blocks
		where s is semesters
		where c is ceil(log2(#classes)) (possibly could be optimized)
	align the bytes in order, representing people as indexes
	possible schedules: 2^(71680) (65536 binary digits, 19729 decimal digits)

Aproach two:
	1 byte per class
	aligning the bytes in order, representing the blocks they are in
